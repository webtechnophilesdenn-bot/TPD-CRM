backend written in PHP.

### Development

See the [developer documentation](https://docs.TPDCRM.com/development/).

We highly recommend using an IDE for development. The backend codebase follows SOLID principles, utilizes interfaces, static typing and generics. We recommend to start learning TPDCRM from the Dependency Injection article in the documentation.

Metadata plays an integral role in the TPDCRM application. All possible parameters are described with a JSON Schema, meaning you will have autocompletion in the IDE. You can also find the full metadata reference in the documentation.
